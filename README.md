# 🦆 Duck Quest: Bread Hunter

Welcome to **Duck Quest**, the premier Duck-based RPG (D-RPG) built for the modern browser. In a world where crumbs are currency and quacks are power, only one Hunter can rise to the top.

## 📜 The Lore
For centuries, the Pond was at peace. But then, the **Golden Goose** appeared, hoarding the Ancient Breadcrusts and throwing the ecosystem into chaos. You play as a novice Duck-Catcher tasked with restoring balance, one 🦆 at a time. 

Will you become a Legendary Mallard Master, or will you run out of bread?

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **The Hunt:** Click on ducks as they appear in the pond to gain **XP** and **Bread**.
2. **Level Up:** As your XP grows, you'll level up, allowing you to encounter faster, more elusive ducks.
3. **Upgrade:** Visit the shop to spend your hard-earned Bread:
   - **Better Nets:** Increases your Click Power (more XP per click).
   - **Auto-Catchers:** Advanced gnomish technology that catches ducks even when you're resting.

## 🚀 Deployment
This game is designed to run on **GitHub Pages**. 

1. Fork this repository.
2. Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3. Select the `main` branch and click **Save**.
4. Your pond is now live at `https://your-username.github.io/duck-dash/`

## 🛠️ Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Classes:** Choose between Warrior (higher bread), Mage (faster spawns), or Rogue (critical clicks).
- [ ] **Boss Battles:** Face off against the Giant
